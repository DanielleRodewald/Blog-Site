    <ul>
        <li>DDL: Data Definition Language is used to create, build, and modify the structure of tables in a database. 
            It also consists of SQL commands that are used to define and describe the database schema.
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>DML: Data Manipulation Language is used to modify data within a database such as adding, retrieving, and updating data. 
            Some DDL commands consist of delete, call, update, merge, insert, and select. </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>DCL:Data Control Language consists of the control over the permissions and access rights of a database. 
            DCL includes the commands grant and revoke, which either allows a users access privileges to a database or retracts previously granted permissions. </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>TCL: Transaction Control Language commands are used to manage transactions within a database such as changes made by Data Manipulation Language statements and allows statements to be grouped together into logical transactions. For example, 
            the commands savepoint and rollback can be used together to temporarily save a transaction and use it as a safe point if any errors occur.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>DQL: Data Query Language consists of SQL commands used to perform queries on data within a database with the purpose of getting a schema relation based on the query that is passed. 
            This consists of the select command which allows operations to be performed on the data that is retrieved.</li>
