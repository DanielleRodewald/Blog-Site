<h2>Six major steps for setting up a database. </h2>

<p>
<b>Step 1. </b>
<br>
Decide the purpose of your database: Ask yourself what is the goal? Who will benefit from this database? What type of information will it include? 
<br>
<br>
<b>Step 2.</b>
<br>
Gather all key data youâ€™ll need for your database and organize it in a way that optimizes readability. 
<br>
<br>
<b> Step 3. </b>
<br>
Ensure you are using best practice naming conventions. This may include camelcasing column names, using underscores, using correct pluralization, and ensuring the column names are simple yet effective.
<br>
<br>
<b>Step 4. </b>
<br>
Specify all primary keys in your database. This will ensure a unique identification for each table and is typically assigned to a column which contains an ID. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Step 5. </b>
<br>
Create relationships among tables: this includes one-to-many, many-to-many, and one-to-one relationships. Based on the type of database you create, you can create a database with a one-to-one relationship if only two tables have related data, a many-to-many if multiple tables have related data to multiple other tables, and a one-to-many database if one table has related data to multiple other tables.
<br>
<br>
<b>Step 6.</b>
<br>
Refine and normalize the design by ensuring the database is structurally correct. This includes checking the database for errors such as redundancies or inconsistent dependencies.
